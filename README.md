Sample Android Project that displays images in Fragments


**Fragments**

A Fragment is a piece of an application's user interface or behavior that can be placed in an Activity. Fragment defines its own lifecycle,
that lifecycle is dependent on its activity, if the activity is stopped, no fragments inside of it can be started; when the activity 
is destroyed, all fragments will be destroyed.It can be designed with Tablayout and ViewPager.


**AsyncTaskLoaders**


Loaders make it easy to asynchronously load data in an activity or fragment. They provide asynchronous loading of data. 
They monitor the source of their data and deliver new results when the content changes.The methods implemented with AsyncTask Loaders are:

1.onCreateLoader()

2.onLoadFinished()

3.onLoaderReset()

**Picasso**


Picasso is a third party library used in projects and for hassle-free image loading in your applicationâ€”often in one line of code!

**CardView**


A FrameLayout with a rounded corner background and shadow.CardView uses elevation property on Lollipop for shadows and falls back to a 
custom emulated shadow implementation on older platforms.


**Manifest Permissions**


Android permissions needed to access the internet and check the network state/status.
